        <h1>What do Ugandans like on Facebook?</h1>
        <p>Facebook remains the most popular social media website in Uganda. As of June 30th 2016, there are approximately <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/">2,200,000</a> Ugandans on Facebook, of whom <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-Facebook-users-are-there-in-Uganda">1,500,000</a> are active users (at least check-in once a day). From a digital marketing perspective, the question then becomes what are all these Ugandans on facebook interested in? Essentially, what do they like? <br><br>To answer this question, I gathered data on the top 50 Ugandan pages, by number of likes, and then categorised each page by what type of page it is e.g. Music, Newspaper, Radio, Politics etc ... The result was the colorful interactive chart below.</p>

         <div id="sub-content">
          <h4>1. Ugandans Like Telecom Companies</h4>
          <p>Ugandans' love for Telecom companies like MTN Uganda, Airtel Uganda, Africell Uganda and Vodafone Uganda is indicative of the love they have for communicating with their phones. Mention the abbreviation "MBs" and most Ugandan Netizens will know exactly what you are talking about. #DataisLife</p>

          <h4>2. Ugandans Like Television, Newspapers and Radio</h4>
          <p>The need to be informed is likely what makes Ugandan's like Television station, Newspaper and Radio station pages on Facebook so much. Being illinformed means not knwoing what other people are gossiping about, or even what hot topics to start gossiping about yourself. Hence pages such as NTV Uganda, NBS Television, WBS Televsion , Stratight Talk Africa, New Vision, Daily Monitor, Galaxy FM, Capital FM etc etc ... rank high in this top 50 list.</p>

          <h4>3. Ugandans Like Music</h4>
          <p>Its no secret that Ugandans love Music. Local Musicians on Facebook have a loyal following and hence appear high on this list of the top 50 most liked pages. Artists like Julianna Kanyomozi, REMA, Bobi Wine, Bebe Cool, Eddie Kenzo, Irene Ntale and Jose Chameleone top the Music category with over 200, 000 local fans, a piece. However, its important to note that some artists like Eddie Kenzo, REMA, and Julianna also have huge fanbases outside Uganda.</p>

          <h4>4. Ugandans Like Entertainment News</h4>
          <p>The love for entertainment news goes back to the Ugandan need to be up to date with popular culture. Pages like Ghafla Uganda, Bigeye.ug, Metro Uganda, RED Pepper Ug and Howwe.BIZ all have a loyal following of fans on Facebook.</p>

          <h4>5. Ugandans Like Comedy</h4>
          <p>In recent years comedy has grown in popularity. Ugandan comics have become mainstream with frequent sold out shows at places like Theatre Labonita and others. However, on Facebook and social media in general, one comic dwarfs not only Ugandan comics, but African comics as well. That comic is Anne Kansiime. Interestingly enough, most of her fans are from other countries, predominantly Kenya and South Africa.</p>

          <h4>6. Ugandans Like Food</h4>
          <p>Among the top 50 pages on Facebook, there just had to be a Food page. It is a well known fact that Ugandans do like their food. Interestingly enough though, "Cafe Javas" is the only Restaurant on this list. Is it an indicator of Ugandan's growing affinity for fast food? Maybe thats why international food brands like KFC decided to set up shop in Uganda, in recent years ...</p>

          <h4>7. Ugandans Like their Finances</h4>
          <p>In the top 50 we have 2 financial institutions, namely; Centenary Bank (the largest local bank in Uganda) and NSSF Uganda (the largest local pension fund in Uganda). </p>

          <h4>8. Ugandans Like their Drinks</h4>
          <p>The only beverage company on this list is "Bell Lager". It would have been peculiar if alcohol did not feature on this list, as Ugandans are some of the <a href="http://eagle.co.ug/2016/05/18/uganda-ranked-africas-2nd-biggest-consumer-of-alcohol.html">heaviest drinkers </a> - not only on the African continent, but also in the world. </p>

          <h4>9. Ugandans Like Online Shopping</h4>
          <p>Its only reasonable that Ugandans online find a way to shop. The page "Buy From USA Receive in Uganda" remains on of the most popular with a large and growing fan following. </p>

          <h4>10. Ugandans Like Politics</h4>
          <p>Ugandans online tend to be very political, and express sometimes radical views on how and who the country should be run by. On this list we obviously have the president ("Mr. Museveni") and his main opposition ("Mr. Besigye"). Museveni leads Besigye with the fan-count, even if you look at only Ugandan fans. Who knows, maybe thats why he keeps on winning elections?</p>
